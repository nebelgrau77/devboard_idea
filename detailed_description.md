### Devboard Idea: details

* STM32L4 MCU (CortexM4, low power, 80MHz)
* ~Arduino Nano~ Adafruit Feather form factor (or Adafruit ItsyBitsy for a version with less sensors), breadboard friendly
* IMU for accelerometer/gyroscope/magnetometer based TinyML 
* PDM microphone for keyword spotting
* temperature/humidity sensor for some environmental monitoring
* NeoPixel for user communication, e.g. green light for "yes", red for "no", etc.
* simple LED for blinking
* serial over USB (serial-to-USB chip like on TinyPICO)
* DFU bootloader
* main interfaces printed by their pins like on ItsyBitsy
* needs SWD pins broken out (ItsyBitsy-style on the shorter end of the board)
