### Devboard Idea: details

* STM32L4 MCU (CortexM4, low power, 80MHz)
* Arduino Nano form factor (Adafruit ItsyBitsy is probably too small to fit the sensors), breadboard friendly
* IMU for accelerometer/gyroscope based TinyML 
* PDM microphone for keyword spotting
* NeoPixel for user communication, e.g. green light for "yes", red for "no", etc.
* simple LED for blinking
* serial over USB
* DFU bootloader
* main interfaces printed by their pins like on ItsyBitsy
* needs SWD pins broken out
